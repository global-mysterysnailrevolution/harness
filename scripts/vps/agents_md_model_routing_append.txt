### Model Routing

Use the cheapest model that can handle the task. This saves significant cost without sacrificing quality.

- **Skill:** [model_routing_skill.md](/data/harness/openclaw/model_routing_skill.md) -- Full decision rubric and tier definitions

**Quick reference:**
- **Fast** (Gemini 3 Flash, GPT 5 Mini): status checks, formatting, file listing, boilerplate, log parsing
- **Standard** (ChatGPT 5.2): coding, debugging, planning, multi-step tool use
- **Deep** (Claude Sonnet 4.5): security, architecture, high-stakes decisions, nuanced writing

**Rules:**
- Default to Fast for research/discovery subagents
- Default to Standard for implementation
- Escalate to Deep only for security, architecture, or when the user says "think hard"/"deep mode"
- User overrides always win: "cheap mode" = Fast, "full power" = Deep
- NEVER use Fast for security analysis, self-update proposals, or credential handling

### Context Packs

Before starting work on a project or module, check if a context pack exists. If not, build one first.

- **Skill:** [context_pack_skill.md](/data/harness/openclaw/context_pack_skill.md) -- How to build, verify, and use context packs
- **Builder:** `python3 /data/harness/scripts/compilers/build_context_pack.py --scope /path/to/project`
- **Verifier:** `python3 /data/harness/scripts/compilers/verify_context_pack.py context/scope-name.md`

**Rules:**
- Always check for existing context packs before re-scanning a codebase
- Build a context pack for any project you work on more than once
- Run the verifier -- don't ship incomplete packs
- Store packs in `context/<scope-name>.md` relative to the project root
