## Current Context

### Repository State
- Git repository initialized
- Files committed locally
- Remote configured and tracking
- Branch: `main`

### Harness Status
- ✅ Context artifacts created
- ✅ Memory checkpointed
- ✅ Structure documented
- ⏳ Files need to be committed and pushed

## Next Steps

1. **Commit all harness files**
   - Add missing context files
   - Commit with descriptive message
   - Push to GitHub

2. **Verify GitHub repository**
   - Check all files are present
   - Verify structure matches local

3. **Documentation**
   - Ensure README is comprehensive
   - Update any missing documentation

## Notes

- Repository is connected to `harness` (not `agent-harness-template`)
- Only 2 files were previously committed
- All harness artifacts need to be added to git

## Memory Checkpoint
This file serves as a checkpoint for agent session state. Update after significant operations to maintain context continuity.
